<h1>The Last Temptation of Homer</h1> <p>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power&hellip;like God must feel when he's holding a gun. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</p> <h2>Homer the Great</h2> <p>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son." I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.</p> <ul> <li>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico?</li> <li>You don't win friends with salad.</li> <li>Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</li> <li>Look out, Itchy! He's Irish!</li> </ul> <h3>Life on the Fast Lane</h3> <p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin&hellip;but what good does *that* do me? But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds&hellip; Oh, I've wasted my life. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!</p> <h4>Cape Feare</h4> <p>This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." Here's to alcohol, the cause of &mdash; and solution to &mdash; all life's problems. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds&hellip; Oh, I've wasted my life.</p> <ol> <li>Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</li> <li>Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.</li> <li>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?</li> </ol> <h5>Radioactive Man</h5> <p>Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?</p>
